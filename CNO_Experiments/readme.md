# CNO Experiments

This folder contains the implementation and experiments for Convolutional Neural Operators (CNO) trained on multi-difficulty PDE data.

## Quick Start

To train a CNO model on low to medium difficulty data, run:

```bash
python TrainCNO_time_L.py
```

For more details on experiments and customization, refer to the main README in the root directory.
