# Setup

This folder runs exactly as the poseidon experiments, and just need to run ./scOT/mixing_poseidon.sh

For mixing the parameters needed to be changed are data paths and alpha values (which range from 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.85 and 1), in the configs/mixing.yaml file.

For wandb setup and run name, modify the ./scOT/mixing_poseidon.sh
